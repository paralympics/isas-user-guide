# Participants (Athletes & Guides)

This chapter described the ISAS main menu item **Participants**, where users can read and modify
personal data relating to the athletes and guides of Paralympic sport. IBSA require a certain amount
of personal information before the athletes may compete in IBSA sanctioned competitions, and the
personal information is entered and uploaded by the NF through these screens. Also handled here is
the classification information of the athletes.

Once an athlete has been selected from the registration, the classification, or the nationality
screen, each other athlete’s page can be directly opened clicking the corresponding icon at the
upper right corner next to athlete’s ID and name.

## Registration & Licensing Statuses <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

IBSA uses two different terms to identify the recognition status of an athlete or guide. In the
following section, guides are considered as athletes.

An athlete is considered as <span class="important">REGISTERED</span> when all required information
and documents (see [Registration Process](participants/registration-process.md))
have been uploaded to ISAS and IBSA confirms correctness. The confirmation is automatically done
without notification to the NF after the NF has completed the upload of data and files. Registered
athletes are those who appear in the IBSA screen **License Management > License Overview &
Application** (see [Licence Overview & Application](licence-management/licence-overview-and-application.md)) with a
license status of _New_ or _Pending_.

The registration of athletes in the central repository tool of the IBSA is free of charge.

Once an athlete is registered in ISAS he obtains a unique identification number, henceforth called
the ISAS ID. It is a simple integer unique through all sports, valid for the rest of the athlete’s
career, and primarily used for identification in results, rankings, any kind of reports and data
exchange processes for major events. If transferred from the IPC’s repository, the athlete’s ISAS ID
and SDMS ID shall be the same. The usage of this ID solves the challenges of different spellings or
name changes due to marriage.

An athlete is <span class="important">LICENSED</span> when the athlete has been registered and
officially received a license.
Distribution of licenses is handled through license packages (
see [Licence Overview & Application](licence-management/licence-application-process.md)). Licensed
athletes
appear in the ISAS screen **License Overview & Application** with a seasonal license number and
license status _Licensed_.
