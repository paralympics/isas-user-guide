# Logs

## Career Log

Each change of an athlete’s career status is logged, as described
in [Career & Name Changes](participants/registration-and-licensing-statuses.md#career-amp-name-changes).
This additional grid summarises all career status changes for all athletes to get a
better overview who updated which athlete that might be useful for a detailed analysis
or retirements and reactivations.

## File Access Log

Each time when any user of ISAS opens or downloads a classification document from the
classification detail page of an athlete (see [Documentation](participants/classification.md#documentation)) or generates a package with
classification
files for a major selection of athletes (see [Classification Files](reports/classification-files.md)), the access to these files are logged here.

The access log finally contains the information about which user identified by the username opened/downloaded which file (file ID and file category)
for which athlete (ID, family and given name) at which exact time. This information is required to fulfil national obligations to prove and monitor
the accesses to these files, especially in case of sensitive information like the medical documentation.

## Identities Log

Each change of an athlete’s name is logged. This additional grid summarises all name changes for all athletes.
