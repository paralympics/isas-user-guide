# Transferring Athletes between SDMS and ISAS

In general, the National Paralympic Committee shall be responsible for such transfers, using their SDMS primary account which has access to all sports
in the system. The ISAS module will only display athletes who have already been registered with an IBSA sport class. Hence, to make an athlete visible
in ISAS, the MF primary user must add the new sport of the athlete in SDMSâ€™ registration & update section; the NF can then make any modifications
within ISAS.
