# Registration Process

The NF must register those athletes who compete for the respective country. Complete registration
and initialization of the review process by the IBSA requires following information and documents
for each athlete:

&check; Personal data – passport name, preferred name, gender, date of birth

&check; Nationality data – to confirm the athlete is eligible to compete for the NF

&check; IBSA Eligibility Form – correctly signed
(see [IBSA Athlete Eligibility Agreement](https://isas.ibsasport.org/doc/form/2023_IBSA_Eligibility_Agreement_Form_Athlete.pdf))

&check; Photo – for guidelines (see [File Attachments](layout-and-functionalities/file-attachments.md))

&check; Sport Class – for identification of the sport in which the athlete shall be licensed

Guidelines of the registration pathway can be found in (see [Registration & Update](participants/registration-and-update.md)).
Please keep in mind that the registration of athletes in ISAS is free of charge and can be done
anytime.

As soon as all documents have been added to the athlete’s ISAS profile, IBSA reviews correctness and
adds the athlete to the list of athletes than can be licensed. For user’s confirmation, the review
process is initialized when the registration status on the profile says _Completed_.

> IBSA does not inform the NF that documents are missing. IBSA only informs the NF when signatures on the IPC Eligibility Agreement Form are missing,
> photo not being acceptable or other inserted values not fulfilling the requirements.

Feedback about non-accepted documents or data can be found in the comment box in the license overview screen. Only in urgent cases, the NF is
individually contacted. In either case, the outstanding information has to be corrected and completed, and IBSA must be personally informed that the
reasons for grievance are resolved for IBSA’s next review.
