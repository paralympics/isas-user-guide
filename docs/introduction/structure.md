# Structure

The current chapter describes the general objective of this manual and briefly summarizes the
history of ISAS development.

[Website, Layout and Functionalities](layout-and-functionalities/access.md) explains how to get an
account for ISAS, how to access this database, the navigation through the application, the menu
bars, and general usages of search forms, and buttons appearing on several pages. Please read this
chapter if you are not experienced with high security applications in general or with ISAS in
specific.

The following chapters begin with the initialization of
ISAS ([Application Settings](application-settings/configuration.md)), each module of ISAS is
considered. The menu sub-structure is reflected by
the respective chapter structure for easy navigation and reference.

An exact step-for-step instruction for registration of participants(
athletes/guides)  ([Participants](participants/registration-and-licencing-statuses.md)) and licence
application and
payment [Licence Management](licence-management/licence-application-process.md) supports the user to
fulfil the requirements and follow the process efficiently.

[Calendar](calendar/competitions.md) concerns the registration of upcoming events and/or
classification panels, their classifiers and attending athletes.

The application produces a set of customisable reports for overview of the stored data. These files
are described in [Reports & Downloads](reports-and-downloads/classification-master-list.md).
Finally, [Account Manager](account-manager/user-accounts.md) contains information about the user
management and security structure built into ISAS.

[IPC Database Issue Tracker](database-issue-tracker/change-requests.md) contains information on the
tool used by the IPC Sports Information Technology department to handle change
requests and defects (a.k.a. bugs) within the ISAS application.

At the end, [Help](help/glossary.md) the section contains the glossary and other information that is
especially important for member federations.
