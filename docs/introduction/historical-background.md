# History and Development of ISAS

In December 2013, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) expressed its interest to use the
IPC Sport Data Management System (SDMS) to administer its sports and related data including
athletes, classification and competitions. SDMS had then been running successfully since 2009, with
a number of small expansions, and has now become the IPC's central tool for athletes' data,
classification, competition calendar, achieved results, confirmed records, and calculation mechanism
of rankings and qualification lists for major events.

After consultations between IPC and IBSA, the federations agreed to realise this new data management
system with a separate look and feel, but with an integrated database allowing for the transfer of
information between the two federations. Also, IBSA will not be integrating results data into the
database. Figure 1.1 shows the division of information between the two applications; note that the
licensing system is kept entirely separate.

The user base of the two systems will in many cases be similar, as National Paralympic Committees (
NPCs) are also often national members (NFs) of IBSA. By using one central database with two public
applications, the processes can remain familiar to users who already know the SDMS application, and
information can be transferred between the two applications as necessary.
