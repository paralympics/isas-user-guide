# Objective

This document describes how to use the ISAS to securely submit, capture, store and retrieve
athletesâ€™ personal data, classification, and licensing by member federations (NFs) into a central
database for IBSA. This manual is targeted to staff members of national member federations of the
International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and aims to assist the users in the following areas
of the system:

- Participant Management (e.g., athlete registration, biography capture, sport class
  assignment)
- License Management (e.g., athlete licence application and payment.
  This manual covers all sections of the application even if different user groups have different or
  limited access to the sections. This is outlined in each section of this user guide.
