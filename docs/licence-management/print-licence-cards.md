# Print Licence Cards

IBSA issues license and ID cards through ISAS, for use as proof of identification at competitions and at other IBSA sanctioned events. The license
card is particularly important for major competitions where licenses are required for entry, and is valid for the length of the season in conjunction
with an ID card. The ID card, which also includes the athlete’s photo, is valid for four (4) years after the date of issue. New cards can be issued at
any time, as long as the athlete is licensed in a currently running season.

Sample pictures of the license and ID cards are shown in Figures 6.8 and 6.9. The standard personal information such as name, NF, gender and date of
birth are included on both; the ID card includes a photograph and the dates of issue and expiry, while the license card includes details on the sport
the athlete is licensed to compete and the timeframe of validity for the license.

For athletes licensed to compete in shooting, the license cards include classification data in place of the name and ID section – such as the sport
class, class status, and details about the allowed weapons and assistance. If the athlete is classified in several classes, these are separated by
slashes. The only personal identification on the shooting license card is the SDMS ID, which can be cross-checked with the ID card.
