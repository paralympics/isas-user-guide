# Address Book

The address book shows all addresses that users from your NF saved from the ordering sections of ISAS, and which can be recalled later. Your private
addresses can not be seen by anyone else in the application; public addresses, such as the IBSA address are available for everyone.

The postal address will be printed on the invoices, which you can print off for your archives.
