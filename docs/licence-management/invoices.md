# Invoices

Once an invoice has been issued by the system after an application by an NF, it must be stored so that it can be accessed by IBSA for an eventual
confirmation of the payment status. These invoices are accessible from this section, along with invoices issued for other IBSA processes such as
competition participation or approval. Invoices can not be created or deleted directly from this screen: instead, they are created as a result of
other processes within ISAS. The invoice details are displayed in a table, with printable PDFs available for archiving and documentation.
