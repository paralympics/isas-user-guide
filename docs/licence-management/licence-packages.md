# Licence Packages for NFs

For individual sports, NFs acquire licences in packages and then issue them to their athletes. This section lists all registered packages that the
user can access, past and current, with most information about the package directly available from the result matrix. Users can restrict the list by
NF season, sport and invoice number.

NFs acquire packages through clicking the _Add License Package_ button, either from the search form or from the details screen. This form, shown in
Figure 5.1, is specifically designed to only provide the relevant options for a purchase, and to illustrate possible savings by buying in bulk.

A buyer then enters their specific data in the fields, as described in the table below, before clicking _Submit Order_ to complete the purchase.

    <small><span class="asterisk">*</span>If empty, the NF default address - currently consisting of the official NF name only - is printed on the invoice PDF as recipient. Otherwise, the address specified here is used in the invoice's header.</small>
</p>

Once the order is submitted, the user processes the invoice and bank payments, and then waits for IBSA to confirm the payment using the Invoices
screen of ISAS. This is described in more details in [Invoices](licence-management/invoices). The package is listed as **Pending** from the search
form until this confirmation is obtained, and the package can not be used to license further athletes until payment is confirmed and the status is
changed to **Paid**.
