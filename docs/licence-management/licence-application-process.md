# License Management

This chapter describes the main menu item **Licenses & Invoices**, where information about the licensing status of athletes within the IBSA sports and
the
IBSA Licensing Programme is stored. The licence application process is described in detail in the introduction section of this chapter, followed by a
description of each screen.

The process can be quickly summarised as follows: NFs apply and pay for licences for their athletes for each sport the athlete will compete in that
season. IBSA do not review the licence applications individually, but rather ensure that the athletes are eligible to compete with complete
registrations before they are made available to NFs to be licensed.

The main elements of ISAS handled through this menu item are payments and invoices, available licences by sport and NF, and the licence status of
individual athletes. The menu item is accessible to IBSA users and NF users.

## Licence Application Process <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This chapter provides a basic step-for-step instruction from registration to final licensing, especially to underline the difference between
individual license applications and license packages. Details on the processes and related technical steps in SDMS are outlined in the respective
chapters of this guide.

## License Packages

#### **How To:** License an athlete

1. Register a new athlete or update an existing athlete by uploading all required data and documents as explained
   in [Registration Process](participants/registration-process).
2. At the same time, purchase a new license package or ensure that one or more packages have left-overs for the actual season (
   see [Licence Packages](licence-management/licence-packages)
   and [Licence Overview & Application](licence-management/licence-overview-and-application)). During the purchase, the package invoice shall be
   printed and immediately paid. Currently, only bank transfer payments are accepted for license packages.
3. Wait until IBSA has reviewed the registration so that the athlete appears in the license section with status New (
   see [Available Athletes, Status and Process](licence-management/licence-overview-and-application#available-athletes-status-and-process)).
   
   a. If the status is not valid, comments explain the issue to be resolved. Once resolved, IBSA shall be contacted for review request of the updated
   documents or data.
   
   b. If the athlete does not appear after the 1-3 working days, ensure that all documents and data are uploaded as required, and nationality is
   confirmed.
   
   c. If the athlete still does not appear although the profile is correctly filled, please contact IBSA.
4. Wait for 1-3 weekdays until IBSA has confirmed the payment of the license package (see[Licence Packages](licence-management/licence-packages)). The
   duration of confirmation might take up to five (5) weekdays depending on your home country and way of payment.
   
   a. If the payment status of the package and related invoice is still pending after five (5) weekdays, IBSA has to be contacted and provided with
   any kind of proof (signed bank transfer documents, receipts…).
5. Go to the license page, and select the athlete(s) to be licensed in a specific sport for the actual or next season (
   see [License Search Form](licence-management/licence-overview-and-application#license-search-form)). After final
   confirmation, all athletes are immediately _Licensed_.

## Payment Options

The standard payment option is the bank transfer order. The IBSA bank account details are indicated on the invoice. The payer shall ensure that he
bears the costs for any additional bank fees.

> [!DANGER]
> The invoice number or numbers covered by the payment shall be indicated during the remittance order. The payer’s effort in this regard is
> appreciated for simplification of payment identification and to avoid delays in the licensing process.

In exceptional cases, a specific request for an alternative solution may be sent to IBSA if the standard method of money transfer does not work due to
country-specific restrictions and limitations.

## License Fees and Validity

The license fee and validity policy might vary from season to season by sport. IBSA will start with the following prices for license packages in the
2015 season:

| Package Size | Package Fee   | Average                |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 5            | 75.-- &euro;  | 15.-- &euro; / license |
| 10           | 130.-- &euro; | 13.-- &euro; / license |
| 20           | 220.-- &euro; | 11.-- &euro; / license |
| 40           | 410.-- &euro; | 10.25 &euro; / license |

License packages are only valid for one season. Left-overs are not transferable. Only due to these policies, IBSA can offer larger packages with the
discount. Multiples of the largest package (80, 120, 160) are available, too, for the same multiple package fee.

The validity of a license generally begins on the day when the NF officially licensed the athlete with help of purchased and paid license package
until the 31 December of the respective season. Since the licensing programme usually opens in October or November, meaning two or three months before
the start of the season, licenses allocated before 1 January are valid from the start of the season onwards.
