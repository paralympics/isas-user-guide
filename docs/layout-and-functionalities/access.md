## Recommended Browsers

It is recommended to use most modern and widely used browsers with recent updates
installed to ensure stable functionality and security. ISAS runs best under latest versions
of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Google Chrome]([version](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). Users of Internet Explorer (
version 9 or higher) shall regularly update and inform about potential general security issues; and
either download a
stable version or look for alternatives. Additionally, JavaScript must be enabled for correct
functionality of ISAS.

> Please note that Internet Explorer has been retired by Microsoft and will be out of support as of
> June 15, 2022.

## User Accounts

Currently, there are four main user groups defined. The most important client group are the member
federations (NFs) who maintain data about their own
athletes and apply for licenses. Secondly,
recognised classifiers have access to the classification section to read out and update information.
The IBSA Management Team runs all remaining
procedures, e.g. maintaining the calendar, updating
classification information, granting user accounts, and supporting the NFs and classifiers. Finally,
the super user groups of system administrators
have full access to information stored in SDMS and
ISAS, and can transfer between them at any point if necessary. Besides those four groups, there are
several individual temporary accounts opened for
various purposes.

> [!DANGER]
> Please share your personal account details with any colleague only if you take on full
> responsibility for all actions performed through your ISAS
> account.

### NF Accounts

Each Member Federation obtains one (1) main user account (**primary user**) to access all athletes
in all sports stored in the system. Additionally,
IBSA may grant one (1) **additional sport-specific
account** per
sport. These accounts may be used by employees of the NPC or any national sport federation in order
to decentralize the obligation of athletes’
registration and licensing. An individual person may
hold two or more sport-specific accounts.

A National Paralympic Committee that already has an account in the IPC’s SDMS can additionally use
their existing primary account in ISAS, as part of
the cooperation between IBSA and IPC.

### Classifier Accounts

In most cases, the IF management team automatically opens an account for the classifier
with access to read out the most updated classification data as required for them to perform
their duties at the competition. The classifier might gain rights to change data. Then it is
highly recommended to carefully read the respective sections of the ISAS manual about
the update of classification values and files to ensure consistent and high data quality.

#### How To: Apply for an ISAS Member Federation account

1) Download the Member Federation Account Request Form for ISAS from the front page.
2) For the primary user, tick **no change** if the user remains the same, **update** for a change of
   email address or ‘new/replace’ for replace the
   responsible person.
3) For a sport-specific account, insert the sport and tick **new/replace**.
4) For the case of a National Paralympic Committee wishing to use a duplicate account, indicate this
   in the correct place on the form. If a new
   primary user is also required for ISAS, please contact
   the ISAS Administrator.
5) Get the document signed by the president or secretary general of the Member Federation and send
   it back to the IBSA office as indicated on the
   form.
6) IBSA will send out individual emails to each designated person with his/her personal username and
   password.

#### How To: Change or update an ISAS NPC account

1) Download the NPC Account Request Form for ISAS.
2) For the primary user, tick **no change** if the user remains the same, **update** for a change of
   email address or **new/replace** for replace the
   responsible person.
3) If one or more sport-specific accounts change, tick **new/replace** for an entire replacement of
   the responsible person or **update** for change of
   email address.
4) Get the document signed by the president or secretary general of the Member Federation and send
   it back to the IBSA office as indicated on the
   form.
5) IBSA will send out individual emails to each designated person with his/her personal username and
   password. If an account has been removed in order
   to create the new one, the previous user will be
   informed about the new status.

**New/Replace** always leads to the creation of a new username if the individual responsible person
has changed. In contrast, **update** keeps the
username as long as the responsible person does not
change but only his/her contact details or organization/position.

## Security and Passwords

ISAS is a password-protected application. This protection requires high standard beginning with
usage of strong passwords. Strength of a password is
primarily defined by its length and its used
character set. To find a compromise between security and user-friendliness, a password for ISAS and
all its related modules requires:

&check; Minimum length of eight (8) characters

&check; At least one (1) lower-case letter [a-z]

&check; At least one (1) upper-case letter [A-Z]

&check; At least one (1) numeric character [0-9]

&check; At least one (1) non-alphanumeric character out of the set [!_%#?-@=$&+]

As it is recommended for all Internet applications, ISAS automatically reminds the user to change
his password when 360 days after last password
change have passed.

> [!WARNING]
> Your account is automatically disabled after five sequential failed login attempts.

### Password Reset

The password reset tool can be used if you have forgotten your password, or if the account
has been locked as described above. Instructions are given below.

#### How To: Change your password

1. After you have entered the application, go to **myAccount** at the upper right
   corner of ISAS. This screen automatically opens after the 90 days period.

</figure>

2. Enter your current password in the first field. The new password is automatically
   controlled against the password requirements. Confirm your new password and
   submit.

#### How To: Reset password when you have forgotten it

1. Click on **I forgot my password** or use the menu bar **key reset**.
2. Fill out the form by inserting your username and email address which had been
   registered with your account.
3. After submission, you receive an automatically generated email with a password reset
   link. Check your spam folder if can’t find the message in your inbox.
4. Follow the link. ISAS opens and allows you to register a new password, respecting
   the password requirements.
5. After confirmation and submission of your new password, navigate back to the login
   page.

Please note that after submission of the password reset in step 2, you need to complete the
remaining steps within 15 minutes. If this time has been passed without completion, you
need to restart at step 1.

Passwords are stored encrypted. That means that no one, even not the ISAS Administrator
can read out your password. Same security standard is applied to other sensible information.

ISAS logs you out after one hour of inactivity. This counter applies to each window or tab of
your web browser independently from each other; but once your session is deleted in one of
these tabs, your access in all of them is denied unless you re-login. This reduces the risk that
a stranger with access to your terminal manipulates the data through your account without
your knowledge. Especially in a public environment, it is highly recommended to click **Logout**
when you finished your work in ISAS.
